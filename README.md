# A Model for Rapid Effective Cognitive Assessment via Eye Movement

We present a novel model for rapid effective cognitive assessment in participants with different neurological and systemic disorders, which is composed of a two-stage network. The first-stage of the network differentiates the eye movement patterns of each eye movement trial from fixation task, saccadic task, anti-saccade task, horizontal smooth pursuit task, and vertical smooth pursuit task. The second-stage of the network comprised a logistic regression model, which is learned to fuse the first-stage network output for cognitive dysfunction. 

The model has robust performance in subgroups of participants stratified by sex, age, education level, hypertension status, diabetes status, and visual impairment status and in the sub-dataset created based on the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in the elderly Chinese population. This study provides a generalizable cognitive assessment model that has the potential to be applied with speed, objectivity, and high efficiency to a broader range of health settings in the future.
